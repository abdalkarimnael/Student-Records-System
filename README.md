# Student-Records-System
This project is the first project in the Linux Lab. It implements a system for managing student records, including operations such as adding new semester records, changing course grades, and generating statistics. The student records are stored in a text file with a specific structure (check the description file to see it).

As shown in the description file of the project:
---
*Year/Semester denotes the academic year and semester (e.g., 2021-2022, 1 for the first semester, 2 for the second semester, 3 for the summer semester).

*The system supports academic years with three semesters: first, second, and summer.

*Grades can range from 60 to 99, or be marked as I (incomplete), F (fail, counted as 55), or FA (fail absent, counted as 50).

Scenario
---
*The program prompts the user to enter the file name.

*If the file doesn't exist, an error is raised.

*Displays available operations:

*Show/print student records for all semesters.

*Show/print student records for a specific semester.

*Show/print overall average.

*Show/print average for each semester.

*Show/print total number of passed hours.

*Show/print percentage of total passed hours in relation to total F and FA hours.

*Show/print total number of hours taken for each semester.
